However, humans are naturally egalitarian (charitable), as seen through governmental programmes of helping those in need (welfare, disability benefits, etc), private charity, daily social engagements, and so forth.</li>",

Post-1960 data shows there was only a drop in calorie consumption as the USSR collapsed. The two nations had markedly different diets, but overall data does not represent this as it is unimportant - malnutrition would be very improbable on such a high calorie diet.
